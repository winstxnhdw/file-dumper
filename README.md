# file-dumper

A simple file dumper web application. On iOS, you cannot natively view files with an unrecognisable type. This means a simple text file with the string `Hello, world!` cannot be previewed if it is not saved as a `.txt` file. There are applications that can do this for you but they are not without ads, so here is an ad-free minimal file dumper, hosted on a distributed CDN, for you iOS users.
